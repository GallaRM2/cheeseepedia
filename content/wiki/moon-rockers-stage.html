The Moonrockers are a retrofitted {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}} Center Stage show created in 1985. The show consists of an Alien band that lives inside the moon, who have travelled 100 years into the past so that they can get onto MTV to spread the message that the world is doing the right thing. <sup>(1)</sup>

<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Creation </h3>
The show was designed by Burt Wilson, and the cosmetics and props for the retrofit were created by Dave Thomas. It was designed to be a retrofit that could be purchased by Show owners who wanted to turn their Rock-Afire Explosion into a brand new show. This retrofit could be purchased for an additional $15,000 on top of the cost of a Rock-Afire Explosion show. <sup>(2)</sup>
<h3> Stage Construction</h3>
The stage was built around a metal frame, and characters valves were attached to the stage. This was so that it could easily be moved to events such as the IAAPA, without the need to take apart the stage. Spotlights were attached to the floodlight bars, due to the fact that it wasn't possible to have a proper spotlight bar on a travelling show. The stage features the same valence used on the Beta Rock-Afire Explosion show. All of the characters are mounted to wooden platforms that can be easily turned around and moved, allowing Admiral Oort to be turned to face straight when being turned back into Fatz. 
<h3> Early Stage</h3>
In the earlier version of the show, the stage had a Space themed valence and black trim. Princess Hailey and Quasar had also swapped places. It is believed these characteristics were changed to the final version to make conversion at the IAAPA easier. Every character's cosmetics were also different, however it's unknown why this was changed.
<h3> Stage Design</h3>
The show replaces all Rock-Afire Explosion props, and removes the Sign, and cover off of Fatz's Organ. Rocks carved out of foam are placed along the ground to cover the floor. There is also a foam rock behind O-Zone, and one behind Princess Hailey, similar to the Sun and Moon trees from the Rock-Afire Explosion. Fatz's Organ is covered with a Purple Organ facade constructed out of wood, turning it into Admiral Oort's Organ. Admiral Oort is also turned to face to his Right, instead of straight forward. A cover is placed over Dook's Platform, which contains O-Zone's drums and lights. In some cases, a platform for a Live Performer was also added in the crater in front of Quasar.

<h3> Volcano Baby </h3>
The Volcano Baby is a Choo Choo retrofit, who is carved out of Foam. The decision to make him out of foam means he hasn't held up as well in recent years, due to the foam disintegrating. The Volcano baby was simply placed on top of the existing Choo Choo cosmetics, meaning Choo Choo is still underneath him to this day.
<h3> Eye Bat </h3>
The Eye Bat is a simple Antioch retrofit, done by disconnecting Antioch from his mechanism, and hooking the Eye Bat on. The Eye Bat has no confirmed name, however, it's speculated that the mold may be labelled as "Dante"
