The Moonrockers are a retrofitted {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}} Center Stage show created in 1985. The show consists of an Alien band that lives inside the moon, who have travelled 100 years into the past so that they can get onto MTV to spread the message that the world is doing the right thing. <sup>(1)</sup>

<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Creation </h3>
The show was designed by Burt Wilson, and the cosmetics and props for the retrofit were created by Dave Thomas. It was designed to be a retrofit that could be purchased by Show owners who wanted to turn their Rock-Afire Explosion into a brand new show. This retrofit could be purchased for an additional $15,000 on top of the cost of a Rock-Afire Explosion show. <sup>(2)</sup>
<h3> Stage Construction</h3>
The stage was built around a metal frame, and characters valves were attached to the stage. This was so that it could easily be moved to events such as the IAAPA, without the need to take apart the stage. Spotlights were attached to the floodlight bars, due to the fact that it wasn't possible to have a proper spotlight bar on a travelling show. The stage features the same valence used on the Beta Rock-Afire Explosion show. All of the characters are mounted to wooden platforms that can be easily turned around and moved, allowing Admiral Oort to be turned to face straight when being turned back into Fatz.
<h3> Early Stage</h3>
In the earlier version of the show, the stage had a Space themed valence and black trim. Princess Hailey and Quasar had also swapped places. It is believed these characteristics were changed to the final version to make conversion at the IAAPA easier. Every character's cosmetics were also different, however it's unknown why this was changed.

The Choo Choo used during the IAAPA when the show was switched out between the {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}} and the Moonrockers still remains underneath the Volcano Baby's cosmetics.
